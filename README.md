# SvgUnityPuppetPoc

My intention of this project is to create a proof of concept for the following,

1. Creation of simple 2D character puppets using vector design package.
2. Using a tool to convert the SVG into a new file format ready for processing in unity.
3. Creation of 2D sprite within Unity using an addin and the file generated in step 2.
4. Make the creation of "clothing" for the character extremely simple and quick.

If the POC works as I hope, I will see if I can create a single Unity package from it that will perform the entire process from within the editor.
